UPDATE 4:27 9/12
Fixed some flaws! :)

PREVIOUSE
I'm not to sure if I got this 100% it will change by the time you read this.
I have no errors when running my html through Nu HTML Checker. So, HTML Codes
are running normally. My style for this unfortunately does not match the website
100%, so I will still do some work on it till the due date which is tomorrow.
